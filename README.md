# calmmute
Calmmute is built upon the idea that commutes are cognitively important: having time between engagements allows our brains to finish processing the last thing we did before it begins work on the next. We noticed that often people either schedule meetings back-to-back, or use their "awkward" between-meeting time to do more work. Both of these scenarios remove the precious commute time and can cause stress and cognitive difficulty.

## Current State of the Software:
**include some screenshots**
The user opts in to the calmmute experience and tells the site how they feel and how much time they have for this.

This takes them to a page where they are served some meditation music and a yoga pose. 
They have the option to get a new yoga pose.
